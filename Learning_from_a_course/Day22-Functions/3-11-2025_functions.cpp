// FUnction call stack : A stack is a datastructure That follows last in first our order(LIFO)

/* By using function call stack : It displays 
Function call
The function calls made by other functions
Functions Local Variables
function return type


-----------------------------------
In C++ Main() function gets executed first. And it contains a function called calculate()
and the Main() calls calculate() and inside the calculate it contains a for loop and it gets executed and bring result back to main().
------------------------------------

Once any function is executed it gets poped() form the stack. And at last The main() function returns 0 and gets poped()
